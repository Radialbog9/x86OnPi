<h2> COMPILING KERNEL (NEEDED FOR WINE TO WORK)</h2>
This step is required for x86OnPi to work. 
Since it comes pre-compiled with support only for 3G/1G vmsplit, we will need to compile our 
kernel to be compatible (this is only the case if your kernel is not compiled with 3G/1G, as 
Raspberry Pi usually comes pre-compiled with a 2G/2G vmsplit).
<br>
Follow this guide from the official Raspberry Pi website to compile your kernel:
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md">
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md
</a>
<br>
You will need to modify the .config file after the
<code>make bcm2709_defconfig</code>
by commenting out the
<code># VMSPLIT_2G=y</code>
and removing the comment block from
<code># VMSPLIT_3G=y</code>
